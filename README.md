Here lies the source code for [my personal site](https://dxmuses.github.io).

I'm changing the theme for the nth time now, seeing that no theme is fitting my taste!
update:
Finally, I'm content with the [sidey theme](https://github.com/ronv/sidey).

Recommended font matter for a post:

```
---
layout: post
title: Adding HTTP response headers to a Netlify static website #post title here
description: Increase the security of your Netlify website by adding security headers
summary: Increase the security of your Netlify website by adding security headers.
comments: true #for disqus comments i guess?
tags: [netlify, coding, security] #add tags like this in a list
category: [Netlify, Code, Security] # same for categories
---
```

Changing colors:

+ To edit the css, change the _sass/_main.scss_ file. Change the overall theme & colors there.
+ To change the colors of tags, edit the hex in tags.html
+ similarly to change the colors of categories, edit the hex in categories.html
+ And finally to change the color of the search box, change the hex color inside _pages/search.md

That's about all the places you can change the colors on the site
